The North American P-51 Mustang is a long range propeller driven fighter aircraft armed with 6, .50 BMG M2 browning heavy machine guns all carrying 9 yards of .50 BMG ammo belts, this is also
where the phrase "the whole 9 yards" comes from, talking about using all you can to accomplish a task, in this case, shooting down an enemy aircraft. Typically these aircraft would escort B-17 heavy bomber aircraft during the german bombing campaigns. gynhb
